# Data-Persistence-Project
Initially, the player enters the name they want to display and then selects "Start game"
The top of the game view will show the highest score and the name of the player who achieved it - the player name and score will not be changed when the player exits the game and restarts (data persistence between sessions)
When a new player scores higher than the current best score, that new score is updated with the new player's name
